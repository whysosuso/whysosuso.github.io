I have always loved small quaint bookshops. Owned by people who care deeply about the books they sell and in the process create an experience 
out of every purchase for the customer. There are several articles out there on how Amazon is killing the businesses of these small bookshops, so I 
wonâ€™t go into that here. 

I want more people to experience the warmth of making a purchase from an independent bookshop (or any independently owned business, for that matter). 
The Indie Bookshop Project is a very straightforward and simple attempt at making it easier for people to discover their favourite bookshops. 

Over the past couple of years, I have visited quite a few of these and have always had a happy time. Like several other resilient independent businesses, 
bookshops too adapted to the ways of shopping during the pandemic and started selling to customers far and wide through their social media pages. 

This list below is a curatation of independent bookshops from across India, some of which also deliver pan India. So the next time you are looking for a book, do 
consider browsing through their catalogues. I wish to travel across the country to visit each one of these in person as well, more updates on that to follow here. 

Happy reading!
