I have always liked building things. While in school I ran a popular quizzing blog called Dork's Corner for about 4 years; in college, besides everything I could to contribute to building the culture, I also set up a merchandise brand, [Macha](https://www.facebook.com/machaitsokay) with some friends and made decent money. There have been other projects as well; a media site called [Discin!](https://discin.in/) to cover the stories of Ultimate Frisbee from India; designing and selling posters for dorm rooms and many more really. Some worked out well, some didn't; but I have had fun pursuing each one of them.

These projects keep me sane, if 3 out of 5 things I am working on are going okay, then life's good. I will keep updating this page with the projects I am working on and will also link each project to a detailed blog once I have enough insights. 

Here are some active projects:

1. **Baksa** - A subscription box that acquaints you with a particular place & its culture. A carefully curated box of edibles, trinkets, literature and more, just enough to give you a sneak peek into the culture and stories of places far from you, one _baksa_ at a time. I will write about the origin of the idea and the execution process once the first set of boxes and ready and sold. You can check [here](https://www.twitter.com/getbaksa/) for updates. 

2. **The Indie Bookshop Project (TIBP)** - I love independently run bookshops and want more people to experience buying books through them. TIBP is a curated list of independent bookshops across India. Next time you are buying a book, please refer to the list [here](https://www.bit.ly/IndieBookshop/), some of them also deliver pan India.

3. **Hop, Skip & Stay** - I recently realised the beauty of Homestays. Saloni and I hop, skip and occasionally stay at homes other than ours. We review them here in our instagram page. We intend to put out at least 8 reviews per year, that is a healthy number of holidays one should be going on, right? [Here's](https://www.instagram/hopskipstay/) the instagram page (@hopskipstay).
