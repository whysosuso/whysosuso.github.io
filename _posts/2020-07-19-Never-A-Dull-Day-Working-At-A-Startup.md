title: Never A Dull Day- My time at a start-up
published: true
---
_I started my career with an early-stage start-up and spent an exciting 14 months before deciding to move on. Here are some of my key observations and learnings from the experience._

----

I joined a bootstrapped Edtech startup right after graduating from Ashoka University. It was a new city with new people around and new schedules to follow. It was no less of an adventure for me than the time I took a ride on the fastest roller coaster in the world. Only this time (unlike the roller coaster ride which had lasted only 1.4 minutes) my adventure lasted for a good 14 months.

As I try to recall, articulate and compile my learnings, there’s one thing that becomes very clear to me - there was never a dull day.

#### ⦿ Finding a buddy and investing in them

An early-stage venture by nature is devoid of structures which makes it likely that the journey of an employee can be filled with chaos. While chaos does lead to creativity and the eventual emerging of structures and patterns, the stress around the chaos can be maddening at times. I was fortunate to have found people within the organisation with whom I could build relationships that became critical spaces to discuss, deliberate and most importantly, vent.

My journey was turbulent right from the beginning. We were working under all kinds of constraints as a team and that often led to moments where I was absolutely lost. The fact that I had a buddy around who shared a similar experience and with whom I could talk about my work and the happenings at the organisation without much hesitation, helped flatten a lot of rumbles for me.

I now realise the importance of such bonds. This buddy becomes a part of your larger support system (consisting of family, friends, romantic partner etc), serving as an emotional anchor and a sounding board- in turn helping one do better at their work. Any genuine effort made towards developing such relationships will have compounding effects over time. _One has to look at this relationship as a symbiotic one and make an effort to sustain and develop it with time_.

#### ⦿ Clarity and Consistency

The setup was always dynamic. It was a combination of short deadlines, seemingly unachievable targets, changing variables and several other constraints. Amidst all the dynamism, for no fault of anyone, the larger vision of the organisation became blurry and did not make sense to me at times. This led to a kind of disillusionment that is seldom desirable.

I learnt that having clarity about what I wanted out of my time at the organisation helped me wade through these short periods of uneasy disillusionments. For me, it was learning how things work in a startup and making relevant contacts. I aspire to own and operate a business myself and looked at my time at the organisation as preparation for the same. 


Since the external variables weren’t always stable I tried to focus on being consistent with my own approach and attitude. I realised that it helped me balance the instability out. Breaking bigger goals into smaller tasks and setting individual deadlines, preparing blueprints for future reference, creating and adhering to a loose routine that I followed at work were some of the things I did to manage the chaos. Over time, I observed that doing my work sincerely, taking constant feedback and working on improving myself contributed towards the stability that I was seeking. 


#### ⦿ An appetite for experimentation

One of the biggest advantages of working in a startup is the fact that it allows one to get exposed to a lot of different things. I naturally have a curiosity to tinker and experiment with things and in the organisation, found room to put it to test. I started off with a lot of enthusiasm for new things but soon found my routine, and got comfortable. Some introspection down the line made me realise that I had to make a conscious effort and indulge in flexible experimentation to make the most out of my experience.

When you’re part of a small team in an up-and-coming organisation, there is always more work to be done than there are people. I decided to pick-up side projects that needed to be worked on but had no defined owner. Soon I was also helping other coworkers wherever they needed a hand. This appetite for experimentation was instrumental in making my learning curve steeper than what it would have otherwise been.

#### ⦿ Building the culture

I went to a fairly new University - my batch was among the first couple of batches. Which meant that I was already exposed to the idea of how culture is built into an organisation and I held the value of culture with high regards. This came in handy when I started working with an early-stage venture.

In the initial stages of an organisation, the culture is never already set in stone. While there has to be a broader sense that the founders will have of the kind of culture they wish to establish within the organisation, it would almost always be a work in progress. This meant that as one of the early hires, I had to be cognizant of the fact that I was a primary stakeholder in the creation of an organisational culture that aligned with the founders’ vision. I was not going to be a mere consumer here, my role was more like that of a farmer indulging in subsistence farming; _I was going to consume what I created._

To be honest, in my early days I was quick to complain about the absence of things and got upset if some things were not how I thought they should be. However, as I spent a couple of months, I figured that it was time I played my part and _contributed instead of only complaining_. I  had conversations with the founders and other coworkers to understand their idea of the perfect culture and then made myself take initiatives to contribute to that shared vision. In this process, I got to lay down the foundations to a critical aspect that will impact several people as the company grows- what can be more fulfilling than that!


#### ⦿ Questioning everything

In my early days, whenever I found something that seemed broken to me, I jumped into suggesting ways to fix the problem. Looking back, I attribute this to the desire to prove myself to my coworkers. With time, I realised that most of these problems were things that were already known. I clearly needed more context before I could actually contribute in a meaningful way.

I started doing my homework and got a sense of why things worked the way they did. _I questioned almost everything and everyone to get this understanding._ I let people know where I was coming from and how I thought this process of questioning and deliberating was going to help the company (which is a shared goal). Approaching the process with a sense of kindness, humility and empathy helped in making the process smooth for me.

Such systems help discover blind spots and often lead to the creation of valuable insights. These insights, if taken seriously, can further help preempt problems and be converted into actionable items to solve those problems. A simple act of being aware and raising the right questions can help combat the romanticisation of firefighting that otherwise exists in early-stage ventures. I was lucky that the founders and my coworkers encouraged me throughout. I had now become an active stakeholder in the overall growth of the company.

These were the things that made my journey wholesome and meaningful. Working with a small team and a growing company will always come with several challenges. These challenges can be very unique for different people and my learnings might not always end up helping everyone who is reading this. My intention here is to create a space for reflection where one can use these learnings as a foundation to further probe and understand what works for them. Good luck!
