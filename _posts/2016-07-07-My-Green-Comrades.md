_A short essay on my relationship with trees._

----

I could never know what it was about the greens that got me hinged on to them. No, green has never been my favorite color, it was yellow, until one day when I found black better. However, trees and their greens are something that have been very dear to me. As a kid who grew up being an introvert, trees became my very first and closest confidants. Growing up in a small city meant I was closer to my special friends, surrounding me in different shapes and forms.

Sometimes, the seven year old me would stare at them and walk them through his plans of being an astronaut when he grew up and sometimes, the 17 year old me would vent off the pains of a broken relationship to them. A soft breeze would blow, and the leaves would gently move as if they were listening, hinting that they have got my back- or so I thought. This always put a smile onto my face. I always thought that this bond was one of the few things that will stay with me throughout the springs and summers of this life, but will it? **_What if there are no more trees around?_**

I live in a bigger city these days and get to see very little of my green friends. Itâ€™s just concrete all around. Nothing moves with the breeze anymore, robbing me of that promised smile. I get to meet the greens once in a while, on an occasional visit to a garden or some place far that they live in, like a forest? Wish they could be everywhere, to put more smiles on more faces, wish more people thought them to be their friends too. Believe me when I say it, they are really good at keeping their friends happy, I have been a witness to that. I miss them. I miss my green comrades.
