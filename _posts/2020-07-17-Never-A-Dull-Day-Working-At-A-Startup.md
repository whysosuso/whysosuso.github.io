title: Never A Dull Day- starting my career at a start-up
published: true
---
_**I started my career with an early-stage start-up and spent an exciting 14 months before I decided to move on. In this essay, I have put down some of my key learnings from the experience.**_

----

I joined a bootstrapped Edtech startup right after graduating from Ashoka University. It was a new city with new people around and new schedules to follow. It was no less of an adventure for me than the time I took a ride on the fastest roller coaster in the world. Only this time, instead of 1.4 minutes, it lasted a good 14 months. 

Here I compile some of my learnings from being a part of a startup and seeing it grow from being bootstrapped to receiving two rounds of funding. More so, I explore what one can expect before they dive in for a similar journey. As I try to recall, articulate and compile my learnings, there’s one thing that becomes very clear to me; there was never a dull day.

#### ⦿ Find your buddy and invest in them 

An early-stage venture by nature is devoid of structures which makes the journey of an employee filled with chaos. While chaos does lead to creativity and eventually structures and patterns emerge, the stress around the chaos can be maddening at times. I was fortunate to have found people within the organisation with whom I could build relationships where there was ample space to discuss, deliberate and most importantly, vent. 

My journey was turbulent right from the beginning. We were working under all kinds of constraints as a team and that often led to moments where I was absolutely lost. The fact that I had a buddy around who shared a similar experience and with whom I could talk about my work and the happenings at the organisation without much hesitation, helped flatten a lot of rumbles for me right from the beginning. 

I now realise the importance of such bonds. This buddy becomes a part of your larger support system (consisting of family, friends, romantic partners etc), serving as an emotional anchor and a sounding board- in turn helping one do better at their work. I would highly encourage finding at least one such buddy and investing in the relationship. _Look at this relationship as a symbiotic one and make an effort to sustain and develop it with time_. You know it is isn’t symbiotic when it is only you are the one talking. 

#### ⦿ Clarity, Consistency and Experimentation

The setup is always going to be dynamic. It is going to be a combination of short deadlines, seemingly unachievable targets, changing variables and several other constraints. For no fault of anyone, the larger vision of the organisation might not make sense and sometimes might not even be decipherable to an employee. This leads to a kind of disillusionment that is never desirable. Being clear about what you want out of your time at the organisation and reminding yourself of the same helps sail through these short periods of uneasy disillusionments. It could be learning about a particular industry, making contacts, picking up different skills or something else entirely. Just try to figure out what it is for you. 

_An overall focus on being consistent with one’s attitude also adds more stability_. Doing your work sincerely, taking constant feedback and working on your improvement will help in this endeavour. The built-up consistency will act as fuel in times of distress and help remain focussed. Such consistent behaviour will also earn you your colleagues’ trust, which is priceless and helps in more than one ways in creating a conducive environment for your growth.  

While such consistency is desirable, do also make some room for _flexible experimentation_. There’s always more work to do than there are people available. Experiment with your own assigned function, pick-up side projects, help your colleagues with things that you find interesting and in the process learn as much as you can. That is one of the greatest advantages that such a system provides, make sure you use it. 

#### ⦿ You are the culture 

In the initial stages of an organisation, the culture is never already set in stone. While there has to be a broader sense that the founders will have of the kind of culture they wish to establish within the organisation, it would almost always be a work in progress. This means that as one of the first employees, you are a primary stakeholder in the creation of the culture. You are not merely a consumer here, but you are more like a farmer indulging in subsistence farming; you consume what you create. 

Talk to the founders and other colleagues to understand their idea of the perfect culture and then take plenty of initiatives to contribute to that shared vision. You get to lay the foundations to a critical aspect that will impact several people as the company grows- what can be more fulfilling than that?

#### ⦿ Question Everything 


As you get acquainted with the way things work and become a trustworthy stakeholder in the company’s growth, the next step is one that involves a constant process of questioning things around you. Question everyone and everything with an intention to understand why things are the way they are. Once equipped with this understanding, you can voice your concerns and suggestions better. Hence helping the overall growth of the company by regularly questioning the status quo and trying to bring in constructive changes wherever possible. 

Make your intentions clear before you engage in this process. Let people know where you are coming from and how you think this process of questioning and deliberation will help the company (which is a shared goal). Approach this process with a sense of kindness, humility and empathy. Encourage others to do the same. 

Such systems help discover blind spots and often lead to the creation of valuable insights. These insights, if taken seriously, can further help preempt problems and be converted into actionable items to solve those problems. A simple act of being aware and raising the right questions can help combat the romanticisation of firefighting that otherwise exists in early-stage ventures.

These were the things that made my journey wholesome and meaningful. Working with a small team and a growing company can always come with several challenges. These challenges can be very unique for different people and my learnings might not always end up helping everyone who is reading this. My intention here is to create a space for reflection where one can use these learnings as a foundation to further probe and understand what works for them. Good luck!
