title: Never A Dull Day- <i>starting my career at a start-up</i>
published: true

_**I started my career with an early-stage start-up and spent an exciting 14 months before I decided to move on. In this essay, I have put down some of my key learnings from the experience.**_

I joined a bootstrapped Edtech startup right after graduating from Ashoka University. It was a new city with new people around and new schedules to follow. It was no less of an adventure for me than the time I took a ride on the fastest roller coaster in the world. Only this time, instead of 1.4 minutes, it lasted a good 14 months. 

Here I compile some of my learnings from being a part of a startup and seeing it grow from being bootstrapped to receiving two rounds of funding. More so, I explore what one can expect before they dive in for a similar journey. As I try to recall, articulate and compile my learnings, thereâ€™s one thing that becomes very clear to me; there was never a dull day.
