title: Never A Dull Day- <i>starting my career at a start-up</i>
published: true

_**I started my career with an early-stage start-up and spent an exciting 14 months before I decided to move on. In this essay, I have put down some of my key learnings from the experience.**_

I joined a bootstrapped Edtech startup right after graduating from Ashoka University. It was a new city with new people around and new schedules to follow. It was no less of an adventure for me than the time I took a ride on the fastest roller coaster in the world. Only this time, instead of 1.4 minutes, it lasted a good 14 months. 

Here I compile some of my learnings from being a part of a startup and seeing it grow from being bootstrapped to receiving two rounds of funding. More so, I explore what one can expect before they dive in for a similar journey. As I try to recall, articulate and compile my learnings, there’s one thing that becomes very clear to me; there was never a dull day.

### Find your buddy and invest in them 

An early-stage venture by nature is devoid of structures which makes the journey of an employee filled with chaos. While chaos does lead to creativity and eventually structures and patterns emerge, the stress around the chaos can be maddening at times. I was fortunate to have found people within the organisation with whom I could build relationships where there was ample space to discuss, deliberate and most importantly, vent. 

My journey was turbulent right from the beginning. We were working under all kinds of constraints as a team and that often led to moments where I was absolutely lost. The fact that I had a buddy around who shared the same experience as me and with whom I could talk about my work and the happenings at the organisation without much hesitation, helped flatten a lot of rumbles for me right from the beginning. 

I now realise the importance of such bonds. This buddy becomes a part of your larger support system (consisting of family, friends, romantic partners etc), serving as an emotional anchor and a sounding board- in turn helping one do better at their work. I would highly encourage finding at least one such buddy and investing in the relationship. Look at this relationship as a symbiotic one and make an effort to sustain and grow over time. You know it is isn’t symbiotic when it is only you are the one talking.
