title: Never A Dull Day- My time at a start-up
published: true
---
_I started my career with an early-stage start-up and spent an exciting 14 months before I decided to move on. Here are some of my key observations and learnings from the experience._

----

I joined a bootstrapped Edtech startup right after graduating from Ashoka University. It was a new city with new people around and new schedules to follow. It was no less of an adventure for me than the time I took a ride on the fastest roller coaster in the world. Only this time (unlike the roller coaster ride which had lasted only 1.4 minutes) my adventure lasted for a good 14 months. 

As I try to recall, articulate and compile my learnings, there’s one thing that becomes very clear to me; there was never a dull day. 

#### ⦿ Finding a buddy and investing in them 

An early-stage venture by nature is devoid of structures which makes it likely that the journey of an employee can be filled with chaos. While chaos does lead to creativity and eventually structures and patterns emerge, the stress around the chaos can be maddening at times. I was fortunate to have found people within the organisation with whom I could build relationships where there was ample space to discuss, deliberate and most importantly, vent. 

My journey was turbulent right from the beginning. We were working under all kinds of constraints as a team and that often led to moments where I was absolutely lost. The fact that I had a buddy around who shared a similar experience and with whom I could talk about my work and the happenings at the organisation without much hesitation, helped flatten a lot of rumbles for me right from the beginning. 

I now realise the importance of such bonds. This buddy becomes a part of your larger support system (consisting of family, friends, romantic partners etc), serving as an emotional anchor and a sounding board- in turn helping one do better at their work. I would highly encourage finding at least one such buddy and investing in the relationship. Any genuine effort made towards developing such relationships will have compounding effects over time. _Look at this relationship as a symbiotic one and make an effort to sustain and develop it with time_. You know it is isn’t symbiotic when it is always only you who is talking. 

#### ⦿ Clarity and Consistency 

The setup was always dynamic. It was a combination of short deadlines, seemingly unachievable targets, changing variables and several other constraints. In all the dynamism, for no fault of anyone, the larger vision of the organisation became blurry and did not make sense to me at times. This led to a kind of disillusionment that is never desirable. 

I learnt that having clarity about what I wanted out of my time at the organisation and reminding myself of the same helped me sail through these short periods of uneasy disillusionments. For me, it was learning how things work in a startup and making relevant contacts. It is going to different for different people. It could be learning about a particular industry, being financially independent, picking up different skills or something else entirely depending on who the person is. 

Since the external variables weren’t always stable I tried to focus on being consistent with my own attitude. I realised that it helped me balance the instability out. Over time, I observed that doing my work sincerely, taking constant feedback and working on improving myself contributed towards the stability that I was seeking. The built-up consistency acted as fuel in times of distress and helped me remain focussed. Consistent behaviour also earned me my coworkers’ trust. They could count on me for getting things done. As I write this down, I can say it confidently that the trust was priceless as it created a conducive environment for my growth.  

#### ⦿ An appetite for experimentation

One of the biggest advantages of working in a startup is the fact that it allows one to get exposed to a lot of different things. I naturally have a curiosity to tinker and experiment with things and had hence taken it for granted. I started off with a lot of enthusiasm for new things but soon found my routine, and got comfortable. Some reflection down the line made it clear that I had to make a conscious effort to indulge in flexible experimentation to make the most out of my experience. 

I could see that there’s always more work to do than there are people available. I tried to use that gap to do as many things that I could. I tried to pick-up side projects that needed to be worked on but had no owner. Soon I was also helping other coworkers wherever they needed a hand (having already developed a trusting relationship helped). This appetite for experimentation was instrumental in making my learning curve steeper than what it was. 

#### ⦿ Building the culture

I went to a fairly new University. My batch was among the first couple of batches. Which meant that I was already exposed to the idea of how culture is built into an organisation and I held the value of culture with high regards. This came in handy when I started working with an early-stage venture.

In the initial stages of an organisation, the culture is never already set in stone. While there has to be a broader sense that the founders will have of the kind of culture they wish to establish within the organisation, it would almost always be a work in progress. This meant that as one of the first employees, I had to be cognizant of the fact that I was a primary stakeholder in the creation of the culture. I was not going to be a mere consumer here, my role was more like that of a farmer indulging in subsistence farming; _I was going to consume what I created._

To be honest, in my early days I was quick to complain about the absence of things and get upset. However, as I spent a couple of months, I figured that it was time I play my part and contribute instead of complaining. I  had conversations with the founders and other coworkers to understand their idea of the perfect culture and then made myself take initiatives to contribute to that shared vision. In this process, I got to lay down the foundations to a critical aspect that will impact several people as the company grows- what can be more fulfilling than that?


#### ⦿ Question Everything 

In my early days, whenever I found something that seemed broken to me, I jumped into suggesting ways to fix the problem. Looking back, I attribute this to the desire to prove myself to my coworkers. With time, I realised that most of these problems were things that were already known and that I needed more context before I could actually contribute in a meaningful way.

I started doing my homework and got a sense of why things worked the way they did. _I questioned almost everything and everyone to get this understanding._ I let people know where I was coming from and how I thought this process of questioning and deliberation was going to help the company (which is a shared goal). Approaching the process with a sense of kindness, humility and empathy helped in making the process smooth for me.

Such systems help discover blind spots and often lead to the creation of valuable insights. These insights, if taken seriously, can further help preempt problems and be converted into actionable items to solve those problems. A simple act of being aware and raising the right questions can help combat the romanticisation of firefighting that otherwise exists in early-stage ventures. I was lucky that the founders and my coworkers encouraged me throughout. I had now become an active stakeholder in the overall growth of the company.

These were the things that made my journey wholesome and meaningful. Working with a small team and a growing company can always come with several challenges. These challenges can be very unique for different people and my learnings might not always end up helping everyone who is reading this. My intention here is to create a space for reflection where one can use these learnings as a foundation to further probe and understand what works for them. Good luck!
