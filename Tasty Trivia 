**About the Event** Tasty Trivia brings together people who enjoy tackling random facts and brain teasers. Whether you're coming solo, with a friend, or as a date night activity, you're in for an engaging evening.

**Format & Focus** Our inaugural edition features an experimental format with questions around Asia and the fascinating interplay of 'India in Asia' and 'Asia in India'. Consider this a test of your allegiance to the continent! The questions are designed to be work-outable rather than based on obscure knowledge, making them accessible while still challenging.

**Prizes** There will be goodies to be won throughout the event. We're excited to have Dorje Teas as our beverage partner, so expect lots of A-grade Darjeeling tea among the prizes!

**Your Hosts** Saloni and Susovan are hosting this event. They're enthusiastic about creating a fun, welcoming environment for all participants.

**Join Us** Whether you're a trivia veteran or newcomer, come ready to learn something new and have a good time.
