Introduction
The Indian Higher Education landscape has been introduced to a new buzzword - ‘holistic’. I am talking about the Holistic Admissions Process (HAP) being 
adopted by colleges. There are several definitions of HAP, but all of them are based on just one core idea. The idea that an individual’s identity is made 
up of several varied parts and that none of the parts alone defines someone's identity. For a system that has for decades valued and solely depended upon 
scores from an examination to recruit students and even Civil servants, the idea of adopting a holistic process is refreshing. 

I was first introduced to the HAP about half a decade back when I was applying for my undergrad at Ashoka University. It was fascinating as it was the first 
time an institution wanted to know about me. Pushing me to define myself not with the grades I received at School but with my thoughts and ideas, my interests 
and ambitions. That did the trick for me, that is majorly what made me join Ashoka later when I was given an offer of admissions. 

In contrast to the HAP, for so long, examination scores have served as gatekeepers to legacy and premier institutions in the country. IITs, NITs, DU, IIMs have
been plagued with skyrocketing cut-offs in the process impacting the behaviour of the lakhs of  ‘aspirants’. Generations of teenagers have spent their time 
aspiring to and preparing to clear these exams.

Goodhart’s law: How cut-offs shape our behaviours.
The good old Goodhart’s law helps us understand this idea of how cutoffs shape our behaviour. It says that ‘when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be 
a good measure’.




I have always loved small quaint bookshops. Owned by people who care deeply about the books they sell and in the process create an experience 
out of every purchase for the customer. There are several articles out there on how Amazon is killing the businesses of these small bookshops, so I 
won’t go into that here. 

I want more people to experience the warmth of making a purchase from an independent bookshop (or any independently owned business, for that matter). 
The Indie Bookshop Project is a very straightforward and simple attempt at making it easier for people to discover their favourite bookshops. 

Over the past couple of years, I have visited quite a few of these and have always had a happy time. Like several other resilient independent businesses, 
bookshops too adapted to the ways of shopping during the pandemic and started selling to customers far and wide through their social media pages. 

This list below is a curatation of independent bookshops from across India, some of which also deliver pan India. So the next time you are looking for a book, do 
consider browsing through their catalogues. I wish to travel across the country to visit each one of these in person as well, more updates on that to follow here.
