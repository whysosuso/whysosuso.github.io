Hi, I am Susovan Mahapatra. I am a 24 year old with a lot of ideas. 

I love conversations, building things, chai, running, cycling, reading and consuming comedy. I use this space to put structure to my thoughts and share it with people who care.

I am passionate about the rapidly evolving Higher Education space across the world and am working towards making my first career and creating impact in the space. 

I graduated from Ashoka University, a greenfield project, where I studied Economics and International Relations and served as a Resident Assistant for two terms. After graduating, I joined the Growth Team at an early stage Edtech start-up. In my first job out of college, I worked across functions of Growth and got a flavour of how alternate education, start-ups and Growth in start-ups work. 

Among all the things that I learnt during my undergraduate years, what got me the most excited was the prospect of building an institution that would outlive all individuals involved. After spending about a year in my first job, I jumped ships to join a technology and research-based Greenfield University project called Plaksha. At Plaksha, I have been part of a 4 member team that is designing and executing the admissions and outreach process; crafting the first undergraduate class.

I also serve on the council of the Ashoka Alumni Association(AAA) as an elected Director. Here, I am building the foundations of the Alumni Association of India's foremost Liberal Arts University. 

Beyond my day job, I try experimenting with some side _[projects](https://whysosuso.com/projects/)_ once in a while, do check them out!

Here's a running _[bucket list](https://whysosuso.com/Susovan-Mahapatra-bucket-list/)_ of things I want to do before I die.
