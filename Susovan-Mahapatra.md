Hi, I am Susovan Mahapatra. I am a 23 year old with a lot of ideas. 

I love conversations, building things, chai, running, cycling, reading and consuming comedy. I use this space to put structure to my thoughts and share it with people who care.

I graduated from Ashoka University where I studied Economics and International Relations and served as a Resident Assistant for two terms. After graduating, I joined the Growth Team at School of Accelerated Learning(SOAL), an early stage Edtech start-up. At SOAL, I worked across functions of Growth and got a flavour of how alternate education, start-ups and Growth in start-ups work in India. 

I will soon be joining Plaksha University's Admissions and Outreach Team. Through my experience at Plaksha, I wish to understand the nuances of the formal higher education space in India.

I wish to start my own venture some day soon. 

I keep a running _[bucket list](https://whysosuso.com/Susovan-Mahapatra-bucket-list/)_ of things I want to do before I die.
